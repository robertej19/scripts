This repo contains 6 scripts to make logging into ifarm and submit, and transferring files between there and local, easier.

To use:

1: clone this repoisitory

2: cd scripts

3: mkdir .pass

4: touch .jlab .submit .username

5: In .jlab, enter your jlab password. In .submit, enter your submit password. In .username, enter your username (no @ symbol or anything following is needed). If you have a different username
for jlab and submit systems, you will need to create a second .username file and slightly adjust the scripts.


USAGE:
read each individual script, but the basic copy protocols are files will be transfered to home directories or current directories on local machines. The login scripts take no arguements.
